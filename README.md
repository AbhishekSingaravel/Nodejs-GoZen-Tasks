NodeJs
1. File System Operations:\
Task: Create a Node.js script that reads a text file, modifies its content, and writes it to a new file.\
Requirements: Use Node.js built-in modules like fs to perform file system operations such as reading and writing files.\

2. Express.js Basics:\
Task: Create a simple Express.js application with routes for handling GET and POST requests.\
Requirements: Use the Express.js framework to define routes and handle HTTP requests.\

3. Middleware Implementation:\
Task: Implement custom middleware in an Express.js application to log request details like URL and method.\
Requirements: Understand the concept of middleware in Express.js and how to use it to modify request and response objects.\

4. RESTful API Development:\
Task: Develop a RESTful API with CRUD operations for a resource (e.g., users, products) using Express.js.\
Requirements: Define routes for handling CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on the specified resource.\

5. Authentication with JWT:\
Task: Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in an Express.js application.\
Requirements: Use libraries like jsonwebtoken to generate and verify JWT tokens and protect routes that require authentication.\

6. Database Integration with Database of your choice:\
Task: Integrate Database with an Express.js application and perform CRUD operations on a collection/table.\
Requirements: Use libraries like Mongoose/pg/Your fav one to connect to a database and define models for interacting with collections.\

7. Error Handling and Logging:\
Task: Implement error handling middleware and logging in an Express.js application.\
Requirements: Handle errors gracefully using Express.js middleware and log error details to a file or console.\

 8. Asynchronous Control Flow:\
Task: Implement asynchronous control flow using async/await or promises in a Node.js application.\
Requirements: Write asynchronous code to perform multiple operations in parallel or sequentially and handle errors appropriately.\

9. Scheduled Tasks with Node.js Cron:\
Task: Schedule recurring tasks (e.g., sending email notifications) using Node.js Cron.\
Requirements: Use the node-cron library to define cron jobs and execute tasks at specified intervals.\

10. Payload Validation Middleware:\
Task: Create middleware to validate request payloads (e.g., JSON bodies) in an Express.js application.\
Requirements: Implement middleware to validate incoming request payloads against a defined schema or set of rules. Use libraries like joi, express-validator, etc to define validation schemas and handle validationÂ errors.\
